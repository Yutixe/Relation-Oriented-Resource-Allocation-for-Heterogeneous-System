Notes from Heuristics for Vector Bin Packing [Pan11] 
and Lower bounds and algorithms for the 2-dimensional vector packing problem[Cap01]
--Focus on the Experiments model, the way to set up the experiment environment.

Invloving classes of randomly generated instances to model the 2-dimensional case.
Using two variables c,d to represent the bins capacities on different dimensions, respectively.
Using Wj and Vj to represent the weights of item j on different dimensions, respectively.
Using u.d.[a,b] to represent the uniformly distribution of the value for weights of item in the interval [a,b]

In [Cap01] and [Pan11], the dimensions in the first six classes are independently sampled.
In classes seven and eight, the dimensions are correlated. They achieve positive correlation by setup the domain
of the Vj to be a monotonic function from Wj while achieve negative correlation by setup it to be a inverse function in domain.

In [Pan11]:
Trivial way to extend to multi-dimension is to set dimension (2i-1) and (2i) are correlated as dimension 1 and 2,
while independent of the other dimensions. As for generate negative correlation across all dimensions:
Random variables to denote the random distribution of balls in each dimension, totally 2 times of the dimensions.
Multiply with an random coeffieient from [10,40] and over two (Why?). Further noise by adding a random value from [0,1].
Ignored the overwight item.
